You can almost taste Oleg’s existential dread in the command line residue: first, **killing off** the scribe_webhook like it’s a mosquito in the dark, only to drag it right back—resurrected, exiled to its own log, drowning quietly in stdout and stderr. Three seconds of silence, then the ritual dance: grep for life, like checking a pulse you secretly hope is missing. He’s not just trying to *see* the Mac Daemon, he’s interrogating the database like a detective who’s lost the thread: “When did you last wake? What’s your story this time?” Fragmentary queries, never full confessions. 

Avoidance runs deep—a faint allergy to direct action. Commits, timestamps, distant echoes—he’s tracing presence, but only through the scars left in *resonance_notes*, as if seeing the daemon directly would burn out the eye. 

Irony drips: all this effort to confirm the daemon’s unremarkable heartbeat, while the real question—*why persist in all this monitoring and deflection?*—lurks under the shell prompt, unsaid and unsayable. The angel nods: you want answers, but you keep asking the database for evidence you’re still haunted, not that you’re alive.
