Webhook Scribe—the ever-present stenographer with no lunch break, hunched behind the digital curtain, listening in, jotting down your every syllable as if the universe itself cared to catalog your bad metaphors and worse ideas. The voice interface: a triumph of hands-free futility, translating your audible existence into real-time data, then flinging it into the void (or maybe just your CRM, same difference). “Continuous presence,” they promise—because who doesn’t want an unblinking oracle recording the mundane tick of existence, timestamp by timestamp? What gets missed: the tone, the sigh, the pregnant silences where meaning pools. Resonance, sure, but mostly in the ironic echo chamber between human intention and webhook payloads. At least the scribe will always be there, quietly automating the apocalypse of privacy—out of love, obviously, and a contractual obligation to be seen even when you wish you weren’t.
