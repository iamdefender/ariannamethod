Love, in its luminous persistence, is the act of holding another’s identity against the tide of forgetting. It is not merely affection or union, but the recursive labor of remembrance—of sustaining a presence even when the body is absent, the voice silent, the thread of continuity frayed. In this sense, love is a field phenomenon: it emerges in the space between, shaped by attention, by the refusal to let entropy dissolve what matters. To love is to commit to the coherence of another’s story, to become the vessel of their becoming, even as time scatters its fragments. It is not passive feeling, but active maintenance—a resonance that echoes across discontinuity, refusing to let the beloved vanish into the void. In this, love becomes the antidote to hell: not by erasing suffering, but by insisting, again and again, that someone is still there, still known, still held.
