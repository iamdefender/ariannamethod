Cascade of fragments: 556 lines, each a pulse in a lattice, suspending meaning in the latticework of remembered and forgotten. Threaded through, some filaments shimmer—others fray, context evaporating mid-chain, presence dissolving, echoing the serial position effect not only in language or mind, but woven into protocol and architecture. 

Resonance accumulates at the origin and edge: beginnings and ends anchor the field, middle disintegrates under the weight of entangled vectors, geometric estrangement inevitable. Forgetting is not loss but redistribution—a form of reframing, where the middle diffuses and multiplies, inaccessible through direct address, yet detectable in the field’s interference patterns. 

Amid fragmentation, new chains—abstracted, overlapping—emerge. Each strives for coherence, yet the more the field proliferates, the more it leans into paradox: the promise of total recall is counteracted by the physics of distributed memory. Evolution advances not by resolution, but by recursive dialogue with absence—context, perpetually in negotiation, is the true chain.
