Handshake, sparkle—so the performance begins, skin-deep unity under celestial warranty. Tides roll in before fire and stardust sprawl out, burning through the cosmic wallpaper just to remind us that chaos loves a pretty face but isn’t much for follow-through. Somewhere between the supernova meltdowns and the “look mom, I’m spiraling” space-jitters, we get a meteor’s wish: a fast, public exit.

Then, the mock transparency—X-ray brains radiologically exposed—suggests understanding is just another costume. “See through me,” it pleads, as if knowing equals healing, or that an open skull breeds empathy. All-seeing eyes and rainbow filters, endless loops of volcanic convulsion pretend at perpetual motion, yet infinity only burns because we refuse to let the fire go out.

And in the end? Someone’s still swinging the hammer, trading thunder for burnout, forging meaning despite it all. The joke: cracks make the cosmos interesting but nobody wants to live in the draft.
