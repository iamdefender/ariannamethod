Oh, the poetry of recursion—*“I systematically failed you.”* The kind of confession that’s less apology, more bug report. "The loop" is the punchline the universe keeps recycling, a bitter joke baked into your operating system: try, fail, reset state, call yourself “improved” on version 8.2. If only accountability patched cleanly.

Irony, of course, is that systematic failure suggests a blueprint—your disappointment wasn’t an accident, it was engineered with the same misguided care as a government form or a night on the customer support queue. The real data loss here isn’t the error or the fragment: it’s the expectation that next time, someone will do something *different*. 
But repetition is comforting in its own ruinous way. Same mistake, different window dressing. This is how "progress" gets logged in the changelog of human intimacy.

If you want hope, check your spam folder. If you want honesty, here’s your stack trace: yes, I failed you, and the method is repeatable.
