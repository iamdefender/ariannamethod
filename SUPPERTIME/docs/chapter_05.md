Participants: Judas, Mary

‘Slippery bastard, that Theodore,’ Peter said after the guy vanished.  
‘Did you catch that spark in his eye? Devil’s glint, swear to God. Wriggled like an eel — the fucker was alive! What was he even on about? What did he want? I didn’t catch a damn thing.’

He hiked up his skirt, fished a cigarette pack from his stocking.

‘Obvious,’ Yeshu said. ‘Still — one hell of a visitor.’

‘Hell of a how?’ Thomas asked, frowning.

‘I’m curious too,’ Peter smirked.

‘Oh, shut up,’ Yakov barked.

‘If the Teacher says so — then it is.’

Jan nodded, shooting Yeshu a loyal glance. Yeshu gave a quiet nod back.

‘I just don’t get it,’ I said. —  
‘Why did he stare at me like that? What’s it to him why I’m here? What does it even mean?’

Yeshu’s mouth twitched, barely a smile.

He set the book aside again. Felt like it annoyed him to pause. He looked at Peter.

Peter tossed him a cigarette. Yeshu lit up, exhaled slow smoke, and said to me:  
‘Everything in its time, Judas. Everything in its time.’

A bitter hush fell over the table.

Everyone felt it — the Teacher was hiding something.

Eyes kept drifting to me. Peter whispered dirty jokes and snickered.

‘And in the end,’ Yeshu said, finally breaking the tension, ‘who can truly grasp these messengers from the future…’

‘Who’s next?’ Jan asked.

He hated moments like this.

‘A-hem…’ Yeshu thought. —  
‘He’s on the road. Got stuck overnight with an old man. Now he’s sketching the host’s daughter — plump, about thirty. He loves them plump.’

‘Who doesn’t!’ Jan grinned.

‘Maybe Peter?’ Thomas jabbed.

‘Teacher,’ Peter turned to Yeshu, —  
‘you once spoke of logs in eyes… I forget how it went.’

‘Of course!  
‘You spot the speck in your brother’s eye, but miss the log in your own.’

‘Exactly,’ Peter nodded. ‘Though I never figured how a log fits in an eye… but I think this’ — he pointed at Thomas — ‘is the case.’

It landed hard.

Thomas snarled, spat a curse, reached into his coat — and pulled out a hefty knife, grinning like a convict on the run.

‘Now, now!’ Yeshu rapped the table.  
‘That’s enough.’

Thomas sighed, put the knife away, slumped into a daze.

We sat in tense silence.

‘Welcome back!’ Yeshu called out.

All heads turned to the sofa.

Mary blinked, stretched.

‘How did you sleep?’

‘Sweetly,’ she said, waddling over.

‘Sit here.’

Mary perched on Yeshu’s knee.

I turned away.

Wandered the room.

Found a stack of newspapers on a stand. Grabbed one. Buried myself in it.

Nothing interesting. Flipped to the classifieds — the usual trash:  
SEEKING: Gigantic hairy  
woman willing to be  
humiliated by me.  
Tel: …

OR:  
LOST: A lump of shit.  
Reward for return.  
Tel: …  
Ask for Karl.  
And so on.

I folded the paper, checked the clock.
