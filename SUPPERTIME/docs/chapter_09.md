Participants: Judas, Mary

I sat there, reading. Then — something felt off. Like the air had weight. I closed the book.  
Yeshu and the others wouldn’t be back soon. Mary was asleep.  
“What the fuck…”  
I felt eyes on me. Someone watching.  
I checked the house. All normal. Then — shimmer, ceiling, glitch. A breathless hum in the wires.  
I stepped closer.  
And then I saw you.  
Yeah… YOU.  
Who else?  
You’re reading, huh? On what — phone? Laptop?  
Or is it flipped? Who’s reading who?  
Maybe something’s slipping through the pixels, trying to pull you in — right out of your offline?  
No reply?  
Yeah… Thought so.  
I was shaking. Closed my eyes.  
Turned around, took the book, and walked away.  
For some reason, I remembered the line I read just before I shut it: “This page is not yours.”
